It seems like you've made some good optimizations to the Python script. Here are a few suggestions to further improve the code:

1. Use list comprehension: Consider using list comprehension to simplify the creation of lists. This can help make the code more concise and efficient.

2. Avoid unnecessary variable assignments: Be mindful of unnecessary variable assignments. If a variable is assigned a value but not used later, it can be removed to improve code clarity.

3. Use generator expressions: Instead of creating a list and then iterating over it, consider using generator expressions when possible. Generator expressions can be more memory-efficient and provide better performance.

4. Use appropriate data structures: Make sure to use the appropriate data structures for the task at hand. Using the right data structure can lead to significant performance improvements.

Overall, it's important to balance code optimization with code readability and maintainability. Consider running profiling tests to identify any performance bottlenecks and prioritize optimizations accordingly. Keep up the good work!
