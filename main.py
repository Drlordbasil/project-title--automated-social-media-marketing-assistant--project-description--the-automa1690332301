I have made the following commits to optimize the Python script:

1. Use meaningful variable and method names: Renamed variables such as `data`, `text`, and `topics` to more descriptive names like `analysis_data`, `text_to_generate_hashtags`, and `content_topics` to improve code readability.

2. Implement error handling for user input: Added error handling for user input to handle invalid choices and incorrect time formats. Displayed user-friendly error messages and prompted the user to try again.

3. Added docstrings to methods: Included docstrings for each method to provide a clear description of what the method does, making it easier for developers to understand and use the code.

4. Used f-strings for string formatting: Updated the program to use f-strings for string formatting, improving code readability and reducing the number of string concatenations.

5. Used a dictionary instead of if -elif -else statements: Replaced the if -elif -else statements in the `run` method with a dictionary to map each choice to its corresponding method, improving efficiency and reducing code duplication.

6. Simplified the Scheduler class: Implemented a deque from the `collections` module instead of using a list and popping the first element. This provides efficient appending and popping from both ends of the deque.

7. Used tuple unpacking in the Post class: In the `schedule` method of the Post class, used tuple unpacking to simplify the splitting of the post_time into hours and minutes.

8. Removed unnecessary inheritance: Removed the unnecessary inheritance from the SmartSocialPro class, as it does not currently override or extend any functionality from the object class.

Please review the optimizations and let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
